# Golden Recipes

#### by Sam Salek 

Golden Recipes is a website for anyone to either find recipes or inspiration for meals to cook. The site was created as my final project for the summer course ***Dynamiska webbapplikationer 2IS220 76008 VT2023***.

The website uses the [**TheMealDB**](https://www.themealdb.com/) API to gather and display recipes.

Golden Recipes is deployed and available at: https://sam-salek.github.io/GoldenRecipes/


#### Note:
- Some links or buttons, like the social media links or "Subscribe" button for the newsletter will  *obviously* not work, since Golden Recipes is **not** a fully real site meant for actual use.

- The website has been *mostly* optimized for screens of a width between 600px and 1920px. Anything outside of that range may cause the site's layout to heavily break.
