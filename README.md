# Golden Recipes

#### by Sam Salek 

Golden Recipes is a website for anyone to either find recipes or inspiration for meals to cook. The site was created as my final project for the summer course ***Dynamiska webbapplikationer 2IS220 76008 VT2023***. 

The website is deployed and available at: https://samsalmag.github.io/GoldenRecipes/

The website uses the [**TheMealDB**](https://www.themealdb.com/) API to gather and display recipes.

#### Important notes:
- Some links or buttons (e.g., social media links or the "Subscribe" button for the newsletter) will not work, since Golden Recipes is only coursework and thus **not** meant for actual use.

- The website has been optimized for screens of a width between 600px and 1920px. Any width outside of that range may cause the site's layout to break.
